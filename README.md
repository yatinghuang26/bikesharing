Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to convince potential backers that bike rental is popular and could likely be a profitable business in Des Moines, IA. Through analysis of NYC data on bike rental, we will draw the conclusion that Des Moines can be just as successful as NY.

Results:

From this graph, we can see that the peak hours for riding are from 7-8am and especially from 5-6pm. This is during August, so if we can make sure the most bikes are available for checkout at that time, this could be the most profitable month.

Males comprise of most of the riders and they only tend to check out a bike for around 10 minutes.

This trend is similar to the trend above; it shows that most renters only checkout bikes for less than 20 minutes.

This pie chart illustrates that the overwhelming majority of bike renters in NYC are male.

This table not only shows that more riders are male, but also that riders of other genders follow the same trend, which is riding at 7-8am or 5-6pm.

The same trend from the previous image of riders preferring to ride at 7-8am or 5-6pm is also demonstrated here.

In this chart, we can see that most subscribers are male, which corresponds with previous charts that illustrated males comprise of most of the ridership.

Summary:
In conclusion, if we want to open this business in Des Moines according to NYC trends, we would want to target male bike riders. Also, we would need to make sure to have the most bikes available during the times of 7-8am and 5-6pm, especially on Thursdays. Additional charts I would do would be the user type on less busy days. There must be some riders that would want to bike around the city so figuring out who they are would help target them as potential subscribers. I would also graph September peak hours because many people love riding in the fall before it gets super cold. This way we can even target them as subscribers by making the necessary amount of bikes available to check out.
